= Lyte's Vagrant boxes =

I'm maintaining a few of my own Vagrant boxes, because I want some truly minimal bases (that means no Puppet or Chef).

Built with VeeWee (https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee).

Hosted here: http://lyte.id.au/vagrant/

= Using with RVM =

Install deps:

`bundle install`

Build a box:

`base_builder sl6-matrix-64-lyte`
